1.  Introduction

   This document proposes controlling specific RTCP message feedback
   send time.  This proposal help sender negotiate RTCP feedback send
   time, better flexibility in defining application behavior.  This
   document defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) parameter
   to negotiate the timing configuration.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  SDP Definitions

   This section defines optional SDP parameters that are used to
   negotiate RTCP feedback message send time.  Time defined is
   applicable to specific RTCP feedback message only.

   An OPTIONAL RTCP feedback specific parameter, "fb-min-time",
   indicates the minimum period T_fb_min_time in milliseconds between
   two same RTCP feedback or wait time before sending feedback message.

   The syntax is as follows:

Internet-Draft     RTCP feedback Message Timing Config     February 2024


   a=rtcp-fb:<rtcp-fb-pt> <rtcp-fb-param>;fb-min-time=<fb-min-time-val>

   where above parameters are explained in [RFC4585] section 4

   rtcp-fb-pt              = /fmt ; as defined in SDP

   rtcp-fb-param           = SP "app" [SP byte-string]
                           / SP token [SP byte-string]

                           / ; empty

   fb-min-time-val         = feedback message minimum time value in
                           milliseconds

   “fb-min-time” may have an OPTIONAL parameter “sync-counter”,
   indicates synchronization counter SYNC-CONTER helps synchronize RTCP
   feedback with RTP timestamp change.

   If T0 is start of time, receiver keeps count of change in RTP
   timestamp as COUNT.  Once COUNT is equal to parameter SYNC-CONTER or
   time elapsed is greater than or equal to T_fb_min_time, receiver
   sends the RTCP feedback.  Receiver resets the counter and time, to
   determine when the next feedback is to be sent.

2.1.  SDP description for RTCP feedback timing configuration

   *  Payload specific RTCP feedback PLI (Picture Loss Indication) with
      minimum interval of 50 milliseconds.  Configuration can be used by
      the receiver to trigger PLI when no decodable unit is available to
      decode for 50ms.

      a=rtcp-fb:96 nack pli;fb-min-time=50

   *  RTCP feedback Generic NACK with minimum time of 1 milliseconds.
      Receiver to wait for 1 milliseconds before NACK RTCP feedback
      message is sent on packet loss.

      a=rtcp-fb:96 nack;fb-min-time=1

   *  RTCP feedback transport-cc with minimum time of 50 milliseconds
      and synchronization counter set to 3.  Receiver to send transport-
      cc feedback on every 3rd change in RTP timestamp change or 50
      milliseconds elapsed, whichever happens earliest.

      a=rtcp-fb:96 transport-cc ;fb-min-time=50;sync-counter=3

3.  IANA Considerations

   An OPTIONAL parameters, "fb-min-time", “sync-counter” are defined.
   See Section 3 for details.

4.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the general security considerations discussed in RTP
   Section 9 of [RFC3550]
